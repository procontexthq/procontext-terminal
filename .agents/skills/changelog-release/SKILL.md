Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

Read CHANGELOG.md, then act based on the arguments.

## Mode 1 - Populate [Unreleased] (no version argument given)

Filter the commit list. Skip:

- `chore(release):` version bump commits
- `test:` commits
- `ci:` commits
- `docs:` commits that are purely internal spec or guide edits with no user-visible effect
- Merge commits

Group the remaining commits into Keep a Changelog subsections:

- `feat:` -> **Added**
- `fix:` -> **Fixed**
- Any commit mentioning security, sandbox, auth, permission, remote control, shell injection, or vulnerability -> **Security**
- `refactor:` or `chore:` that changes observable behavior -> **Changed**
- `refactor:` or `chore:` with no user-visible impact -> skip

A change is **user-facing** if it affects someone installing, configuring, or using the terminal app: new app features, terminal behavior changes, agent protocol changes, IPC/API changes, packaging changes, settings added or removed, platform support changes, breakage requiring action, or security fixes. Internal refactors with identical observable behavior, internal spec/doc edits, CI changes, and test-only changes are not user-facing and must be skipped.

Write clean, user-facing prose entries under `## [Unreleased]`. Do not copy raw commit subject lines. Rewrite them as clear, concise changelog entries describing what changed for someone using the app or agent API.

Rules:

- Only add entries not already present in `[Unreleased]`
- Do not touch any existing versioned release sections
- If there is nothing user-facing to add, say so and make no edits

## Mode 2 - Write release section (version argument given, e.g. `0.2.0`)

- Rename `## [Unreleased]` to `## [<version>] - <today's date>`
- If a version argument is supplied, run `pnpm exec semantic-release version --print`
  to get the authoritative next version. If the argument does not match, stop and
  warn. This is the single source of truth; do not guess from commit prefixes.
- If the version argument is `auto`, run `pnpm exec semantic-release version --print`
  and use the returned version.
- Insert a fresh empty `## [Unreleased]` section above it with no subsections
- Update the comparison links at the bottom of the file:
  - Update the `[Unreleased]` link to compare from the new tag: `v<version>...HEAD`
  - Add a new versioned link `[<version>]: .../compare/v<prev-tag>...v<version>` where `<prev-tag>` is the last release tag shown above
- Do not modify the content of any sections; only rename, reorder, and update links
- Do not modify `package.json`, tags, or release workflow files. Only update
  `CHANGELOG.md`.
